<h1>Pattern - RDF List</h1>
<p>This wizard creates an RDF list whose elements are restricted to individuals of a
given class.
<p>RDF lists can be useful to retain order, but have no semantics in OWL and therefore
cannot be reasoned with.
<p>eg. An RDF list could be used to describe processes that must follow a particular
order. Remember, the list cannot be reasoned with using DL reasoners.

<p>The wizard will create:<ul>
<li>A subclass of RDF list that can only contain individuals from a certain class</li>
<li>A property that can be used to create restrictions with this list</li>
<li>Optionally, a restriction on a given class using this list</li>
</ul>
