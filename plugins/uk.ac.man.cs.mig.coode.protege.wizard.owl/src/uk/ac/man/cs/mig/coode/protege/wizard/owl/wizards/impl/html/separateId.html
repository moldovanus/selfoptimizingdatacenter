<h1>Refactor: Separate ID</h1>
<p>This wizard replaces all class names with a unique ID and moves the current
name to a user definable property on the class.
<p>It then set the browser slot to be this new property in order that navigation
is not affected.
<p>Separating the name from the class ID gives more flexibility in naming,
allows classes with the same name and makes it easier to provide translations
for an ontology.
