<h1>Pattern - Value Partition</h1>
<p>This wizard creates a pattern known as a "Value Partition" (VP).
<p>This pattern describes a set of values that can hold for a particular property and are
 used in a restriction to describe a particular feature of a class.
<p>In a VP, the possible values are represented by a set of disjoint classes
that may form their own tree.
<p>If a hierarchy is not required an alternative pattern to use is the Enumeration.
<p>The set of individuals described by the VP is split between its subclasses.
<p>There can be no individual instance of the VP that is not an instance of one of its
subclasses.
<em>
<p>eg Value Partition <b>Spiciness</b> has subclasses <b>SpicinessHot</b> and <b>SpicinessMild</b>
<p>or "All references to spiciness must be hot or mild"
</em>

<em><p>This wizard will import the CO-ODE meta ontology if not already imported</em>

<p>The wizard will create:<ul>
<li>A ValuePartition class</li>
<li>A set (or tree) of subclasses representing the "values" of the ValuePartition</li>
<li>A property that has this VP as its range</li>
</ul>
