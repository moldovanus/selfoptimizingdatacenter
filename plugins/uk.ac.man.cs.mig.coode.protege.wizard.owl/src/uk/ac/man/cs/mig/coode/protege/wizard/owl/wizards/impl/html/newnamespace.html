<h1>Refactor: Move to Namespace</h1>
<p>This wizard allows a selection of classes or properties to be moved into an
 existing or a new namespace.
<p>Although a referencing URL is required for new namespaces, the resources
 will remain in the current file.
<!--p>It is hoped that an export mechanism will be developed to split the model into separate
files.-->
