<h1>Add Annotations</h1>
<p>Add a set of annotations to a group of classes.
<p>This could be especially useful in combination with an import of the Dublin Core metadata
set (OWL menu) for maintaining authoring information.
<p>The annotation set will be retained for reuse for the remainder of your session.
