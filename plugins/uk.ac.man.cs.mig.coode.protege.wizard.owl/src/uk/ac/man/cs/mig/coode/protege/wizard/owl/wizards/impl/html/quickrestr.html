<h1>Quick Restriction Wizard</h1>
<p>Add sets of Existential (SomeValuesFrom) restrictions along a given property (or properties)
to a number of classes easily using a matrix.
<ul>
<li>Only <b>Necessary &amp; Sufficient</b> Restrictions are created</li>
<li>The matrix can only add fillers that are Named OWL Classes</li>
<li>Only values from the range of the property are allowed</li>
<li>Only single values can be added for functional properties</li>
<li>Where multiple classes are entered, the effect is an intersection of multiple restrictions
that are created (matching the conditions widget semantics)</li>
</ul>
<p>Closure can be managed for all properties chosen in the matrix - ie a closure axiom will
be created if none exists or updated if one can be found that matches the original fillers.
<p>A closure axiom is in the form of a Universal (AllValuesFrom) restriction that acts along
 the given property. It has a filler of the union of all the Existential restriction fillers
 along the same property.
