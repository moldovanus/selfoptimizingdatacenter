<h1>Pattern - Enumeration</h1>
<p>This wizard creates a pattern known as an "Enumeration".
<p>This pattern describes a set of values that can hold for a particular property and are
 used in a restriction to describe a particular feature of a class.
<p>This is an alternative representation of the Value Partition pattern, but in an
 enumeration, the possible values are represented by a set of individuals, so no sub-partitioning
 is possible.
<p>The property created should only be used in restrictions that have a filler of
one of the individuals in the Enumeration.

<em>
<p>eg Enumeration <b>Spiciness</b> has subclasses <b>spiciness-hot</b> and <b>spiciness-mild</b>
<p>or "All references to spiciness must be hot or mild"
</em>

<p>The wizard will create:<ul>
<li>An Enumeration class</li>
<li>A set of individuals representing the "values" of the Enumeration</li>
<li>A property that has this Enumeration as its range</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the new Enumeration under the <b>Pattern</b> class
