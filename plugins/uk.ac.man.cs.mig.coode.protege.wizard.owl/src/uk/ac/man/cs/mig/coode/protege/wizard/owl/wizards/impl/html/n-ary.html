<h1>Pattern - N-ary Relation</h1>
<p>This wizard creates a pattern known as an "N-ary Relation".
<p>In OWL, properties can be used to create binary relationships between individuals.
<p>However, sometimes we want to say things about the relationship itself:
<em>
<p>eg property <b>hasTemperature</b> may relate <b>Patient</b>s to
<b>TemperatureValue</b> but we also might want to state that the temperature
has a trend from <b>TemperatureTrend</b> which can be either <b>TempRising</b>,
<b>TempConstant</b> or <b>TempFalling</b>
</em>

<p>The wizard will create:<ul>
<li>An n-ary relation class</li>
<li>A property with the relation class set as its range</li>
<li>A set of properties that are attached to the relation class</li>
<li>Placeholder classes for the range of these properties (if they do not already exist)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the new N-ary Relation under the <b>Pattern</b> class
