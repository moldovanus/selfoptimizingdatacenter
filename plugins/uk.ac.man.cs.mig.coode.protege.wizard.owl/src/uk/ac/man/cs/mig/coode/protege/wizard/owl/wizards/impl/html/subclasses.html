<h1>Create Multiple Subclasses</h1>
<p>Enter a list (or tree using tab indentation) of classes, which will then be created
 as subclasses of the current class.
<p>Other features include adding pre and postfixes, cut and paste from other sources
 and automatically validating that terms are valid Protégé names.
<p>Disjoints can then be added automatically between all new siblings.
