<h1>Pattern - OWL List</h1>
<p>This wizard creates an OWL list.
<p>OWL lists can be useful to retain order, and retain semantics and therefore
can be reasoned with. It is possible to create several "styles" of list.
<p>eg. An OWL list could be used to describe processes that must follow a particular
order.
<p><b>WARNING 1 - Creating large lists (&gt;200 elements) can be very slow and possibly crash Protege.
Start Protege with a greater java stack size and memory before attempting this.</b>
<p>WARNING 2 - this wizard imports the CO-ODE meta ontology - this can only be undone
using the standard mechanism on the metadata tab.

<p>The wizard will create a class that restricts the classes of a sequence of individuals, matching a particular pattern:<ul>
<li>Members must start with a given series of elements</li>
<li>Members must end with a given series of elements</li>
<li>Members must contain a given series of elements</li>
<li>Members must exactly match a given series of elements</li>
</ul>
